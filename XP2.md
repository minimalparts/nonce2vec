# Experiments (2nd round)

Refctoring:
- window size = full sentence
- no window decay and sample decay (useless on nonces dataset anyway)
- fixed bug with alpha
- summing on whole context (not set of context)
- 'duran' nonce is tested twice in test set. We removed the second occurence

## Replication with Aurélie's background model
with random subsampling (sum + train)
SUM: 0.00909 (no-reload)
N2V:

## Filtering context
Filters:
1. No filter
2. Random filter
3. Self information filter
4. Context word entropy filter
